        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This is a traditional Chilean snack, or maybe an appetizer. The truth is that it's a snack eaten during wintertime, especially when it rains. It is typical to arrive home after walking through the rainy streets of Santiago and sit down to have a cup of tea and eat a couple of sopaipillas. You can also eat ones sold by street vendors, but they usually don't taste as good as homemade ones. If you can't find zapallo, pumpkin is a good substitute.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>9 ounces zapallo squash</li>
                <li>4 Â¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>\
                <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>10 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
                <li>2 cups canola oil for pan-frying</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Peel, seed, and cut zapallo into chunks. Place in a saucepan, cover with water, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Cook until zapallo is soft and easily pierced with a fork, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain and allow to cool slightly.</li>
                <li>Mix flour, baking soda, and salt together in a mixing bowl, and set aside. Stir together squash and melted butter. Stir the flour mixture into the butter mixture until blended. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until soft and satiny, adding a little more flour if necessary. Cover dough with a towel and allow to rest 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Roll out the dough to 1/8-inch thick, and cut into 3-inch diameter circles. Poke each circle a few times with a fork to make holes and prevent rising.</li>
                <li>Pour oil into a large, deep skillet and heat over medium-high heat until hot, 385 degrees F (195 degrees C). Place several of the dough circles into hot oil; cook until lightly browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Cook remainder of dough circles in batches.</li>
            </ol>
